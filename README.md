Scrape and analyse libguides

## Quick start

Install [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Install dependencies:

```
pipenv install
```

Enter the virtual environment:

```
pipenv shell
```

Note: use `exit` when you want to get out of the virtual environment. It is not the `deactivate` in conventional virtual environment.

If certain dependencies are missing, install them and update the `Pipfile` in one command:

```
pipenv install {package-name}
```
